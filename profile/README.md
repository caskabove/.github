# Hello Welcome to the CaskAbove Organization Page ðŸ‘‹
We are building a tech company.  This is the location where we will collaborate add new ideas and focus on our goals.
In a nutshell. CaskAbove started out a purely informational page on captive chameleon care. This was the humble beginning. Through this, I learned a great deal. As time progressed through some ups and downs I decided to expand CaskAbove. 

## What is the goal of CaskAbove LLC.
Our goal is to focus on small non-profits by donating to start-ups and maintaining websites to increase their local presence, donation collection, and member organizations. 

## Getting Found and SEO
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) Will be a significant part of what we do. This is the hardest part for a small non-profit and this is an area where we can help. We are a new company we are looking to create a network of traffic that has a positive influence. That is why we picked non-profits, specifically small non-profits. These are the people that are making a difference biggest difference locally and can benefit the most from what we offer..
