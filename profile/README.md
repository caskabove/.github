## Hello Welcome to the CaskAbove Organization Page 👋
We are building a tech company.  This is the location where we will collaborate add new Ideas and focus on our goal.
Look in the Projects section to see the current projects.

Remember this is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It will take time and dedication. I believe that if we stay focused we can build a sustainable company for the future. 
Our current focus is on building websites through the use of WordPress with the goal of getting a starting minimum of three sites, but we would like more.  There is not a specific focus on the type of site  however we do want an accompanying affiliate sales site for sites that do not focus on sales.

What's The Plan?
Initially, as we get sites up and running we want to focus on generating traffic to our sites through the use of SEO optimization.  The long-term goal will be to create a network of sites that we use to generate traffic.
